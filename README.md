# xr-dom-overlay-react
React, Babylonjs and xr-dom-overlay

**NOTE** this will not work on your machine.  I am using a locally built `@babylonjs/core` and `react-babylonjs`.  I will update then the PR is merged.

For the immersive-ar experience you will need a mobile device. I was using a new version of chrome - you may need to turn on XR flags:

The purpose of this demo was to bring in the DOM UI - in this case a React Material UI into the immersive AR scene.
